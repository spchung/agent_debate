This paper provides a toolbox that meets the needs of researchers interested in a lin-
ear panel data model with interactive effects and possibly multiple structural breaks. The
toolbox allows researchers to test for the presence of breaks, and, if breaks are detected, to
estimate the location of the breaks and construct conﬁdence intervals for the true break-
points.
The new toolbox is employed to study the effects of the US Federal Reserve’s QE in-
terventions during 2005–2021 on bank lending. The idea behind QE is that banks should
transform the reserves generated by the interventions into loans, which should in turn in-
crease consumption and employment. However, since the composition of banks’ balance
sheets affect the amount of loans they create, the impact of QE on lending is not a priori
clear. Our results suggest that while QE has led to a number of breaks in bank’s lend-
ing behaviour, it is only towards the end of the sample period that lending has increased
signiﬁcantly.

Notes : The table reports the results obtained by ﬁtting (4.1) by CCE while allowing the coefﬁcients of
both MBS and non-MBS to be breaking. “COEF”, “EST” and “SE” refer to the estimated coefﬁcient,
the associated point estimate and its standard error, respectively. Here d1is the coefﬁcient of the ﬁrst
regime, while Dj=dj+1 djis the change in the coefﬁcient from regime jtoj+1. All models are ﬁtted
with cross-sectional averages of the regressors to account for unknown interactive effects, and ﬁxed
effects, GDP and Inﬂation as observed common factors. The ﬁxed effects are allowed to be breaking,
while the coefﬁcients of GDP and Inﬂation are not. The included bank-level controls are Total assets,
Equity, ROA, Bank cash, Cost of deposits, and Net income. The superscripts “*”, “**” and “***” denote
statistical signiﬁcance at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels, respectively.

least one of the estimated coefﬁcients of MBS or non-MBS securities holdings have a negative (positive) and signiﬁcant coefﬁcient.
