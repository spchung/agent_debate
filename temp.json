{"debate_summary":"The paper presents evidence indicating that Quantitative Easing (QE) programs implemented by the Federal Reserve have not been successful in significantly increasing bank lending over the long term. The analysis, based on extensive panel data, finds that although there were several structural breaks in bank lending behavior coinciding with QE interventions, the overall effect on lending has been minimal. Most banks used the liquidity generated by QE to increase reserves rather than expanding lending, particularly during the earlier phases of QE. Despite some increases in lending towards the end of the sample period, the overall conclusion is that QE has not effectively spurred credit flow in the US economy as intended. This suggests that QE may not be a reliable policy for fostering long-term economic growth.","key_points":["The study covers 3,557 banks over 64 quarters from 2005Q3 to 2021Q3, providing a robust dataset for analysis.","Results indicate that while there were structural breaks in lending behavior due to QE, the net effect on lending was just barely positive.","Most banks opted to build up reserves rather than increase lending, undermining the intended expansionary effect of QE.","The estimated breakpoints align with significant QE events, suggesting a failure of QE to stimulate lending effectively during those periods.","Overall, the analysis concludes that QE has not been an effective policy for long-term economic growth, as indicated by minimal increases in lending despite substantial liquidity injection."],"text_stance":"against","author":"Jan Ditzen, Yiannis Karavias, Joakim Westerlund","title":"MULTIPLE STRUCTURAL BREAKS IN INTERACTIVE EFFECTS PANEL DATA AND THE IMPACT OF QUANTITATIVE EASING ON BANK LENDING"}
