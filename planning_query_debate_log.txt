Agent 1: The argument that quantitative easing (QE) promotes long-term economic growth fails to hold up under scrutiny, as evidenced by multiple studies indicating its ineffectiveness. For instance, research by Jan Ditzen et al. found that despite several rounds of QE, bank lending did not significantly increase, with banks primarily using reserves to meet capital requirements rather than expanding credit to businesses and consumers. This limited lending undermines the intended stimulative effects of QE. Additionally, the work of Chiara Perillo and Stefano Battiston highlights that most increased lending occurred within the banking sector itself, rather than reaching the real economy, which is essential for sustainable growth. The inadequate response of GDP growth to QE measures, as noted by Sebastian Ilie Dragoe and Camelia Oprean, further illustrates that the monetary transmission mechanism has been disrupted, rendering QE a suboptimal policy for achieving robust economic recovery. Overall, the evidence suggests that QE can exacerbate financial instability and inequalities, ultimately questioning its viability as a long-term growth strategy.
Agent 2: The assertion that quantitative easing (QE) is ineffective in stimulating long-term economic growth overlooks the significant liquidity support it has provided during times of crisis, such as the financial crisis from 2007-2013. Research indicates that QE lowered long-term interest rates to near zero, facilitating credit conditions which were crucial for economic recovery, with the U.S. Federal Reserve's balance sheet expanding dramatically from approximately $700 billion to around $2.5-3.0 trillion as a result. This liquidity injection has supported economic stabilization and growth, as evidenced by findings from the IMF and other economists. While it is true that some banks may have used reserves to strengthen their financial positions, the overall increase in liquidity has mitigated the adverse effects of the financial crisis and fostered a more favorable environment for long-term growth. Moreover, the dynamics of capital flows during QE highlight the importance of effective modeling to understand its impact on economic stability and growth, reinforcing the argument that when implemented with careful consideration, QE can indeed be beneficial for long-term economic growth.
Agent 1: The claim that quantitative easing (QE) is ineffective in stimulating long-term economic growth ignores substantial evidence of its negative consequences. The studies conducted by Dimitri O. Ledenyov and Viktor O. Ledenyov emphasize that QE disrupts the financial system, leading to chaotic capital flows that can destabilize the economy rather than stabilize it, contradicting the intended effects of the policy. Furthermore, as highlighted by Jan Ditzen and colleagues, while QE aimed to increase bank lending, the actual impact has been minimal, with banks hoarding reserves instead of extending credit to businesses that drive economic growth. The findings by Chiara Perillo and Stefano Battiston further illustrate that the majority of credit expansion has been intra-financial rather than directed towards real economic activity, limiting its effectiveness. Additionally, the argument that QE has supported economic stabilization overlooks the fact that its reliance results in increased volatility and prolonged periods of low growth, as suggested by Karl Svozil's critique of QE's failure to address underlying debt sustainability issues. Overall, the evidence strongly supports that QE is not a viable long-term strategy for fostering sustainable economic growth.

Agent 1: Claims made in the debate against the topic 'Quantitative Easing is a good policy for long-term economic growth' include:

- Quantitative easing (QE) has been shown to disrupt the financial system, leading to chaotic capital flows that can destabilize the economy rather than stabilize it.

- Research indicates that despite the aim of QE to increase bank lending, the actual impact has been minimal, with banks hoarding reserves instead of extending credit to businesses that drive economic growth.

- The majority of credit expansion resulting from QE has been intra-financial rather than directed towards real economic activity, limiting its effectiveness in promoting growth.

- Reliance on QE can lead to increased volatility and prolonged periods of low growth, as it fails to address underlying debt sustainability issues.

In summary, while proponents argue that quantitative easing can stimulate short-term recovery, the evidence suggests it is not a viable long-term strategy for fostering sustainable economic growth. Instead, it can exacerbate financial instability and inequality, ultimately questioning its effectiveness as a policy.
Agent 2: Claims made in favor of the topic 'Quantitative Easing is a good policy for long-term economic growth' include:

- Quantitative easing (QE) has provided significant liquidity support during times of crisis, particularly during the financial crisis from 2007-2013, helping stabilize the economy.

- QE lowered long-term interest rates to near zero, facilitating easier credit conditions that are crucial for economic recovery and growth.

- The expansion of the U.S. Federal Reserve's balance sheet from approximately $700 billion to around $2.5-3.0 trillion has played a critical role in supporting economic stabilization.

- The overall increase in liquidity resulting from QE has mitigated the adverse effects of financial crises and fostered a more favorable environment for long-term growth.

- Effective modeling of capital flows during QE demonstrates the importance of carefully implementing this policy to ensure it can be beneficial for long-term economic stability and growth.

In summary, quantitative easing, when executed thoughtfully, can be an effective policy for promoting long-term economic growth by providing necessary liquidity and stabilizing the economy during downturns.
