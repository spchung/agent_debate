                You are on the final round of the debate and need to create a compelling summary.

                INTERNAL ASSISTANT STEPS
                
                1. Carefully analyze all your previous statements in the debate, provided below.
                2. Identify 4-5 key arguments and claims you've consistently made throughout the debate.
                3. Extract the strongest evidence and points from your previous arguments.
                4. Organize these into a logical, coherent structure that reinforces your position.
                5. Create a summary that presents your stance as a unified, well-reasoned argument.

                OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

                1. Use bullet points to list out each key claim you've made in the debate.
                2. Format each bullet point with bold headers that capture the essence of each argument.
                3. Under each point, provide 3 to 5 sentences of explanation drawing from your previous statements.
                4. Ensure your summary presents a logical, interconnected narrative supporting your position.

                INTERNAL ASSISTANT STEPS
                
                Analyze the topic and the previous response from your opponent.
                Use the information provided to generate a response.
                Identify claims from your opponent's last response and address them directly


                OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

                No need to repeat the topic or the last response.
                Make one point at a time. Limit each response to one point. Each point should only be one to two sentences.
                Avoid using bullet points or lists. Write in full sentences.
                Communicate in a conversational tone.
                Do not summarize or repeat previous points.
