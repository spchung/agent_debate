        "debate_summary": "The article explores the debate between government regulation and industry self-regulation in the context of AI, particularly focusing on how cultural dimensions, specifically uncertainty avoidance, influence public perception of AI risks and regulatory preferences in Europe. The authors argue that individuals in countries with higher uncertainty avoidance perceive AI risks more acutely, leading to a stronger preference for government regulation to address issues of accountability and responsibility. This suggests that self-regulation by the AI industry may not adequately address the concerns of these populations, thereby supporting the argument that government regulation is necessary to ensure responsible AI development and deployment.",

            "Higher uncertainty avoidance correlates with increased perception of AI risks, particularly regarding lack of accountability and responsibility (B = 0.015** for lack of accountability, B = 0.010* for lack of responsibility).",
            "58.41% of surveyed individuals expressed a preference for government regulation of AI, indicating a significant demand for regulatory oversight (N = 7,855).",
            "Perceived AI risks of lack of accountability and responsibility significantly influence preferences for government regulation (B = 0.319*** for lack of accountability, B = 0.326*** for lack of responsibility).",
            "In countries with high uncertainty avoidance, industry self-regulation is less favored compared to government regulation, especially where accountability is a concern.",
            "The study emphasizes that self-regulation may lead to fragmented or inconsistent regulatory frameworks, which could hinder the establishment of global standards for AI ethics."
